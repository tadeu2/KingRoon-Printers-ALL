[screws_tilt_adjust]

screw1: 30,40
#   The (X, Y) coordinate of the first bed leveling screw. This is a
#   position to command the nozzle to so that the probe is directly
#   above the bed screw (or as close as possible while still being
#   above the bed). This is the base screw used in calculations. This
#   parameter must be provided.
screw1_name: delante izquierda
#   An arbitrary name for the given screw. This name is displayed when
#   the helper script runs. The default is to use a name based upon
#   the screw XY location.
screw2: 205, 40
screw2_name: delante derecha

screw3: 205, 120
screw3_name: centro derecha

screw4: 120, 120
screw4_name: centro

screw5: 30, 120
screw5_name: centro izquierda

screw6: 30, 205
screw6_name: detras izquierda

screw7: 205, 205
screw7_name: detr√°s derecha

#   Additional bed leveling screws. At least two screws must be
#   defined.
speed: 50
#   The speed (in mm/s) of non-probing moves during the calibration.
#   The default is 50.
horizontal_move_z: 5
#   The height (in mm) that the head should be commanded to move to
#   just prior to starting a probe operation. The default is 5.
screw_thread: CW-M3
#   The type of screw used for bed leveling, M3, M4, or M5, and the
#   rotation direction of the knob that is used to level the bed.
#   Accepted values: CW-M3, CCW-M3, CW-M4, CCW-M4, CW-M5, CCW-M5.
#   Default value is CW-M3 which most printers use. A clockwise
#   rotation of the knob decreases the gap between the nozzle and the
#   bed. Conversely, a counter-clockwise rotation increases the gap.
